# Docker Image for Dogecoin

Such containers. Much Doge.

This is a docker image for [Dogecoin](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin) which uses the sourcecode from the official
repository and builds from source, so that this image can be trusted. Unlike many other images which are not always
obvious about whether or not other malicious artefacts have been inserted.

Current release builds version: ```v1.14.9```
